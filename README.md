# **3D Human-Object Interaction in Video:** *A New Approach to Object Tracking via Cross-Modal Attention*

A novel framework for 6-DoF (Six Degrees of Freedom) object tracking in RGB video is introduced, named H2O-CA (Human to Object -- Cross Attention). This framework adopts a sequence-to-sequence approach: it utilizes a method for the regression of avatars to parametrically model the human body, then groups offsets in a sliding-window fashion, and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to attend human pose to object pose.

The study commences by comparing datasets and regression methods for avatars in 5D (TRACE/ROMP/BEV/4DH) and scrutinizing various coordinate systems, including absolute, relative, and trilateration techniques, with the BEHAVE dataset being employed throughout. The significance of human pose in tracking tasks is explored by juxtaposing it with a baseline encoder model that relies solely on object pose.

Various training configurations, differentiated by their loss functions, are investigated for the tracking task. Additionally, the framework is compared with other object-tracking methodologies (DROID-SLAM/BundleTrack/KinectFusion/NICE-SLAM/SDF-2-SDF/BundleSDF). The approach is particularly effective in scenarios influenced by human actions, such as lifting or pushing, which direct object movement, and in instances of partial or full object obstructions.

Qualitative results are illustrated [here](https://jwings1.github.io/H2O-CA/). Although the fully recursive tracking approach does not achieve state-of-the-art performance, the potential of next-frame prediction and next-4 frames prediction is acknowledged. The primary application envisioned is in augmented reality (AR).

  <em>H2O-CA pipeline. In step 1, in a fully recursive approach, the first 8 frames of the video are equipped with an arbitrary reference frame, and successive relative offsets of the position and orientation of the object are computed. In step 2, the sliding window W in input (width 12, offset 1), and the sliding window O of offsets (width 2, offset 1) are portrayed. In step 3, a method for regression of avatars has been applied. In step 4, the regressive unit H2O-CA yields, after hot initialization (green), fully recursive predictions (light blue).</em>

#### Unzipping Sequence Files

After downloading all the sequences, you can extract them using the following command:

```bash
unzip "Date*.zip" -d sequences
```

#### 2. Set up paths

For dataset creation, paths to various resources in make_dataset.py are required. Here are the defaults used in the project:

- **GT Annotations**: `/scratch_net/biwidl307_second/lgermano/behave/behave-30fps-params-v1`
- **TRACE Results**: `/srv/beegfs02/scratch/3dhumanobjint/data/TRACE_results`
- **Object Template**: `/scratch_net/biwidl307_second/lgermano/behave`
- **BEHAVE Split File**: `/scratch_net/biwidl307_second/lgermano/behave/split.json`

#### Adjusting Paths

Please adjust the paths according to your project's storage and organization:

1. **Dataset File Path**: Change the `data_file_path` to retrieve a generated dataset
   ```python
   data_file_path = "/your_path_here/datasets/your_dataset_here.pkl"
   ```

2. **Base Path for Annotations**: Update `base_path_annotations` to where your annotations are stored.
   ```python
   base_path_annotations = "/your_path_here/behave/behave-30fps-params-v1"
   ```

3. **Base Path for TRACE Results (or the method of choice)**: Modify `base_path_trace` if your TRACE results are stored in a different location.
   ```python
   base_path_trace = "/your_path_here/data/TRACE_results"
   ```

4. **Template and Split File Paths**: Ensure `base_path_template` and `path_to_file` reflect your directory structure.
   ```python
   base_path_template = "/your_path_here/behave"
   path_to_file = "/your_path_here/behave/split.json"
   ```

## Training 

### Running the job

You can explore certain hyperparameters through a grid search by setting their ranges as flags, as shown in the example:

```bash
sbatch H2O_train6_object.sh --first_option='pose' --second_option='joints' --third_option='obj_pose' --fourth_option='obj_trans' --name='block_cam2'
```

### Cluster Job Submission Guide

#### SLURM Script Template

Below are parts of SLURM script train_model.sh. Ensure you replace the placeholders with the actual paths relevant to your setup.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --job-name="train model"
#SBATCH --error=/your_path_here/H2O/h2o_ca/log/error/%j.err
#SBATCH --output=/your_path_here/H2O/h2o_ca/log/out/%j.out

# Set up the Conda environment
source /your_conda_path_here/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate evaluation

# Set necessary environment variables
export PYTHONPATH=/your_path_here/smplpytorch/smplpytorch:$PYTHONPATH
export CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA=11.8
export WANDB_DIR=/your_path_here/H2O/h2o_ca/log/cache

# Execute the Python training script
python /your_path_here/H2O/H2O_ca/train_model.py "$@"
```

#### Adjusting Paths

- **SBATCH Directives**: Adjust the paths in `--error` and `--output` to point to your log directories.
- **Conda Activation**: Replace `/your_conda_path_here/etc/profile.d/conda.sh` with the path where your Conda is initialized.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `PYTHONPATH`: Update with the path to your Python modules or packages if necessary.
  - `WANDB_DIR`: Set this to the directory where you want Weights & Biases to store its logs.
- **Python Script Execution**: Change the path in the `python` command to where your training script is located.

### Running Your Job

After adjusting the paths in the SLURM script, monitor your job's progress through the SLURM utilities (`squeue`, `sacct`, etc.) and the log files specified in the SBATCH directives.

Make sure all paths and environment names are correctly set to match your project and cluster environment.

The execution calls `/scratch/lgermano/H2O/h2o_ca/data/make_dataset.py` to create and store data in `/scratch/lgermano/H2O/data/raw` or retrieve it, then save it into `/scratch/lgermano/H2O/data/processed`. The entire BEHAVE dataset takes up 4 GB. Choose the labels to train and pick the architecture you want to train in `train_model`. Optionally, you can initialize with old checkpoints.

### Dataset Usage Example

To access and utilize the dataset for research or application development, you can follow this Python code snippet:

```python
# Assuming 'data' is your dataset loaded from the pickle file
num_camera_views = len(data)
print(f"Number of camera views in the dataset: {num_camera_views}")

# Accessing data from the first camera view
first_camera_view_data = data[0]
num_frames_first_view = len(first_camera_view_data)
print(f"Number of frames in the first camera view: {num_frames_first_view}")

# Accessing the first frame in the first camera view
first_frame_data = first_camera_view_data[0]
frame_keys = first_frame_data.keys()
print(f"Data keys available in a frame: {frame_keys}")
```
